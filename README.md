## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks forming a two-stage spatial analysis pipeline:

- **Stage 1 – `MAIN_script`**: Prepares and processes single-cell tabular data for downstream spatial analysis. This script performs the complete core workflow, including phenotyping, clustering, cell neighbourhood analysis, and intercellular distance calculations.  
- **Stage 2 – `Squidpy_script`** *(optional)*: Uses Squidpy for additional spatial analyses, such as creating Delaunay graphs, generating spatial plots suitable for later overlay on tissue images, and serving as a starting point for more advanced spatial statistics.

The pipeline was originally developed for a glioblastoma (GBM) spatial proteomics project but can be applied to any dataset of segmented single cells derived from multiplexed images of FFPE tumour sections from surgical tissue samples.

### Expected input data

The workflow expects a tabular dataset where:  
1. **Biomarker intensity values** are provided for each detected cell, calculated for the whole cell and/or subcellular compartments (e.g., nucleus, cytoplasm, membrane).  
2. **Spatial coordinates** (`X_centroid`, `Y_centroid`) represent the geometric centroid of each cell.  
3. *(Optional)* **Morphological measurements** (e.g., cell area, nucleus area) are available for quality control and filtering.

### Purpose

The pipeline enables the generation of:  
- Single-cell phenotyping maps  
- Phenotypic metrics (based on biomarker intensity patterns)  
- Spatial metrics, including cell neighbourhood composition and intercellular distances  
- Clustering visualisations (e.g., heatmaps, t-SNE, UMAP)  
- Optional Squidpy-based outputs for Delaunay graph analysis and advanced spatial inference

It can be adapted to match the research aims, including using different marker panels, thresholds, or clustering methods.
